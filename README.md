# 📊 TripleTen Business Intelligence Project Portfolio

Welcome! This is a collection of data analytics projects completed during my time at the TripleTen BI Analytics Bootcamp. Each project demonstrates how I apply tools like Tableau and spreadsheets to solve real business problems and generate insights.
Other projects and exams for SQL and Power BI were completed in the Tripleten website therefore are not files to be uploaded.
