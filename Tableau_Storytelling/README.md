# 📘 Storytelling with Data – Understanding Returns at the Superstore

## 🧠 Problem
The Superstore is facing a high number of returned orders, and leadership wants a clear explanation of the root causes and strategies to reduce return volume.

- Identify causes behind product returns
- Visualize trends and patterns in return behavior
- Build an interactive dashboard and narrative to guide executive decisions

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Tableau
- Superstore dataset (`Superstore.xls`)
- Calculated fields
- Story Point dashboards
- LEFT JOIN (Orders + Returns)

## 🔍 Project Breakdown

### Part 1: Analyzing Returns
- Created a `Returned` calculated field (`Yes` = 1, `null` = 0)
- Developed worksheets to analyze:
  - Correlation between sales and returns (scatterplot by subcategory)
  - Return rate by product category
  - High-return customers (filtered to >1 order)
  - Return rate by geography (map view)
  - Return seasonality (monthly trends)
  - Composite visuals with filters for category, region, and time

### Part 2: Dashboard Design
- Sketched multiple mockups and chose the most effective layout
- Used containers to organize insights logically
- Highlighted KPIs, added filters, and guided user interaction

### Part 3: Storytelling & Presentation
- Created a Tableau Story with annotated Story Points:
  - Summary of return trends
  - Analysis of root causes
  - Dashboard walkthrough
  - Recommendations for next steps

- Presented findings in a short video walkthrough
